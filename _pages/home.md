Our research is foused on 

We are a dynamic research group, at the [Leiden Institute of Physics](http://www.physics.leidenuniv.nl) and soon at [LMU](https://www.physik.lmu.de/en/index.html). Our aim is to explore and understand quantum materials, including strange metals, high-temperature superconductors, and quantum critical electron matter. To this end, we develop new quantum sensing and quantum imaging instrumentation to get the key quantum mechanical degrees of freedom. We want to be able to build the perfect instruments to answer the scientific questions we deem most important (see [Research](research)). 


We are very much looking forward to being part of [LMU physics](https://www.physik.lmu.de/en/index.html)! We will build up our instruments right in the center of the city, in the “Sommerfeldkeller”, where Sommerfeld himself worked. We will exchange ideas with world class groups working in quantum physics, cold-atom many-body physics, and 2d quantum materials.

Our move to LMU will likely start around Summer 2024, depending on the state of renovations. 

Currently, we are located at Leiden University, the birthplace of superconductivity and home to Kamerlingh Onnes, Lorentz, Huygens, Einstein, de Sitter, and others (see e.g. [the wall of signatures from Ehrenfest lecturers](https://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/history/colloquium/muur_heel.html)). 

We are grateful for funding from Leiden University, [LMU ](https://www.lmu.de) [NWO](www.nwo.nl) ([Vidi talent scheme](http://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/programmes/Talent+Scheme) and the [Frontiers in Nanoscience program](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/research/research-projects/science/frontiers-of-nanoscience-nanofront)), and from an [ERC starting and consolidator grants](https://erc.europa.eu/funding/starting-grants).


**We are  looking for passionate new graduate students and a postdoc to join the team** [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/openings) **!**
