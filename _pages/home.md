We are a research group focused on advancing our understanding of hypersonic flows by successfully applying stochastic methods to advance the state-of-the-art models, simulations and experiments. The work carried out by the Stochastic Hypersonics Research Group is truly interdisciplinary at the interface of applied mathematics and aerospace engineering. We focus on answering the question **what can we really learn about hypersonics flows with increasingly complex models and experiments?** In particular, the role of uncertainties, and how they impact our capabilities to build predictive models and understanding of the physical phenomena involved in these flows, is still very poorly understood. Seeking the answer to this problem, our research bridges the gap between hypersonics and rigorous uncertainty modeling techniques.


<!-- The study of hypersonic flows has always been a catalyst to answering fundamental questions in fluid mechanics. It has also helped solve challenging technological problems such as enabling crewed and robotic Space exploration, enhancing military capabilities and future transportation needs. Currently, hypersonic science development relies on three fundamental pillars: mathematical models, experiments and numerical simulations. All three are very important assets of scientific research. Modelers are developing increasingly sophisticated models with large parameter spaces to acommodate the multiphysics and multiscale nature of these flows. Experimentalists are also developing increasingly complex facilities and measurement techniques to measure what has not been possible to observe before. Computationalists are implementing such complex models while developing better and faster algorithms to run at speeds never imagined before. Nevertheless, there is critical communication that has to happen among them all to really advance the field. Large, sophisticated mathematical models are not necessarily predictive if we are not able to validate them. Their validation relies on what is possible to measure in experimental facilities and flight experiments. As measurements of any kind concerning hypersonic science are still very limited, we can only produce under-constrained models that need assumptions to make predictions, introducing important biases. Complex experiments can also be deeply affected by unknowns. It very often happens that not all characteristics of an experimental facility are completely known, leaving us with experiments that have to be interpreted through models, again introducing biases. This leads to a crucial question, **what are we really learning about an aerospace system with these increasingly complex models and experiments?** In particular, the role of uncertainties, and how they impact our capabilities to build predictive models and understanding of the physical phenomena involved, is still very poorly understood. Seeking the answer to this problem, our research bridges the gap between hypersonics and rigorous uncertainty quantification techniques. -->


<!-- The main objective of the lab is to advance our understanding of hypersonic flows, and this can only be done by including uncertainty as a modeled component both in our computational tools and experimental methods. -->

Practically speaking, we are focused on the development and application of stochastic methods belonging to the broad areas of sensitivity analysis, surrogate modeling, forward uncertainty propagation, Bayesian inverse problems, optimization under uncertainty, and data-driven approaches, all of them applied to a broad range of problems in hypersonics. We are interested in investigating how to rigorously consolidate, guide and improve the development of models and experiments for high-temperature gas-surface interaction, gas-phase chemical kinetics, boundary layer transition, aerodynamic performance, and shock layer radiation.
