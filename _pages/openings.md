You will have the chance to work on the grand challenges of hypersonic flight, often at the interface of applied mathematics and fluid dynamics. You will be involved in developing computational tools and methods, generating new ideas, and substantially contributing to the field of hypersonic flight research.

### Prospective graduate students

<!-- **We are currently open for graduate students and postdoc applications** -->

<!-- We are  looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit! -->

If you are interested in joining the Stochastic Hypersonics Research Group, I strongly recommend that you apply to the graduate program within the AEM department and mention your research interests in your statement of purpose.  Once you have filed your application, please email Prof. del Val and provide a short statement of why you are interested in this group.

### Prospective undergraduate students

UMN undergraduate students should email Prof. del Val and provide the following information.

- Introduce yourself (name, major, year).
- A brief explanation of why you are interested in joining the Stochastic Hypersonics Group.
- What time commitment you are interested in (Honors student, UROP, summer researcher, volunteer).

### Prospective postdoctoral researchers

If you are interested in joining the Stochastic Hypersonics Research Group, please email Prof. del Val and provide a copy of your CV and a short statement of why you are interested in this group.

<!-- ### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions
If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send me an [email](mailto:milan.allan@gmail.com). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ or _"Application Postdoc"_ in the subject line. If you are applying to a specific advertisement, note this in your email.

We especially welcome postdocs with fellowships. I'd be happy to support you, also after you apply to our group. Take a look at the [veni fellowship](https://www.nwo.nl/en/calls/nwo-talent-programme-veni-science-domain) or the Marie Curie fellowship (currently closed, next deadline probably Fall 2021, [here is last years call]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/h2020-wp1820-msca_en.pdf)). In many country, there are also fellowships available for outdoing postdocs.**


### Master projects for Leiden University students
If you are a Master student at Leiden University looking for a Master project, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office.

### Bsc / Master students from elsewhere
If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree at Leiden University, see [mastersinleiden.nl](http://www.mastersinleiden.nl/programmes/physics/en/introduction). Sometimes, we take master students or summer interns if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades and a personal recommendation). -->
