# Open positions

**We are currently open for graduate students and postdoc applications**

We are  looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

You will have the chance to work on the grand challenges of hypersonic flight, often at the interface of applied mathematics and fluid dynamics. You will be involved in developing computational tools and methods, generating new ideas, and substantially contributing to the field of hypersonic flight research.

### Master projects for Leiden University students
If you are a Master student at Leiden University looking for a Master project, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office.

### Bsc / Master students from elsewhere
If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree at Leiden University, see [mastersinleiden.nl](http://www.mastersinleiden.nl/programmes/physics/en/introduction). Sometimes, we take master students or summer interns if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades and a personal recommendation). -->
