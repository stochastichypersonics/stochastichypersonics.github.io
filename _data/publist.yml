  description: The determination of the catalytic properties of thermal protection materials is a complex task subjected to experimental and model uncertainties. We have developed a stochastic methodology that allows us to say, for the first time, that the catalytic parameters can be effectively learned from plasma wind tunnel data.

  description: Can we improve our catalytic parameters estimation by acting on our experimental methodologies? In this work, we use stochastic techniques to propose an experimental methodology that can yield much more accurate estimation of our parameters of interest governing heterogeneous gas-surface interactions relevant to hypersonics. The methodology is also tested and a set of plasma wind tunnel tests are performed to validate our approach.

  description: Why does cuprate superconductivity break down at a certain doping level? Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy we find that an emerging metallic matrix inside the superconducting state is responsible for the overall reduction of Tc and the superfluid density, while leaving the gapsize unchanged. The formation of the matrix is tied to a pair breaking process violating a core principle of mean-field theories.

  description: We use our atomic-scale scanning tunneling noise setup on a disordered superconductor, and discover a state above TC that, much like an ordinary metal, has no (pseudo)gap, but carries charge via paired electrons.
