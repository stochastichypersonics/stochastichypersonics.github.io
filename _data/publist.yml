  description: The determination of the catalytic properties of thermal protection materials is a complex task subjected to experimental and model uncertainties. We have developed a stochastic methodology that allows us to say, for the first time, that the catalytic parameters can be effectively learned from plasma wind tunnel data.

  description: Can we improve our catalytic parameters estimation by acting on our experimental methodologies? In this work, we use stochastic techniques to propose an experimental methodology that can yield much more accurate estimation of our parameters of interest governing heterogeneous gas-surface interactions relevant to hypersonics. The methodology is also tested and a set of plasma wind tunnel tests are performed to validate our approach.

- title: "Stochastic calibration of a carbon nitridation model from plasma wind tunnel experiments using a Bayesian formulation"

  description: The literature for nitridation models shows great scattering and sensitivity to particular ad-hoc techniques adopted by the different groups. No account of uncertainties or confidence in the derived models is found. We propose a Bayesian formulation to calibrate nitrogen ablation models for carbon preforms using different measurements of the same flowfield jointly, which has not been attempted before. The benefits are twofold\: we gauge the different levels of information that measurements of recession rates and ablation products densities bring as well as cross-validate experimental data to rule out bad measurements which otherwise we have no other way of identifying, affecting heavily our results.

- title: "Quantification of model-form uncertainties affecting the calibration of a carbon nitridation model by means of Bayesian Model Averaging"
  image: Arrhenius_scheme.png
  description: When everything is affected by uncertainties (e.g. observations, model predictions and model selection) how do we compare models among each other on the basis of the same experimental observations, particularly when they have di↵erent complexities? If different models are to be entertained and cannot be discarded, how can we incorporate the uncertainty these different choices bring to our predictions? We devised Bayesian Model Averaging frameworks to answer these questions and provide a suitable way for the hypersonics community to do so. This is the first time that robust evidence-based technniques are used to assess models with data, informing future research directions.
