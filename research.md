# Research

Our research uses stochastic methods as the basis for advancing our understanding of hypersonic flows.  We develop stochastic modeling techniques applied to a broad range of hypersonic flow problems. Our research truly lives at the boundaries between applied mathematics and Aerospace engineering.
