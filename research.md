# Research

Modeling uncertainty is one of the key challenges in hypersonics today. Only a handful of all the produced research include uncertainty as a modeled component. New, surprising insights are being gained by trying to attain some objectivity in model calibration and validation tasks. Our research uses stochastic methods as the basis for advancing our understanding of hypersonic flows by developing stochastic modeling techniques applied to a broad range of hypersonic flow problems. Our research truly lives at the boundaries between applied mathematics and Aerospace engineering.
