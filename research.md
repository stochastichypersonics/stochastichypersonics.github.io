# Research

Modeling uncertainty is one of the key challenges in hypersonics today. Only a handful of all the produced research include uncertainty as a modeled component. New, surprising insights are being gained by trying to attain some objectivity in model calibration and validation tasks. As an interesting side note, the natural sciences (e.g. Physics, Astronomy, Astrophysics, Particle Physics, etc) have already understood this since quite some time. Actually, most of the recent notable discoveries in Science (e.g. gravitional waves, Higgs boson, etc) can only be confirmed with enough certainty to claim that "something new has been discovered" only if rigorous uncertainty and Bayesian inference analyses are carried out. It is very interesting to see that Nobel Prize-worthy research papers are like a masterclass in Bayesian inference techniques! However, us in Engineering disciplines have been left quite behind on this matter. Once our disciplines have reached a substantial level of complexity, ad-hoc techniques used to guide experiments and validate models are no longer reliable. This complexity pushes us to embrace more mathematically rigorous techniques that can unbiasedly look at our models, our experiments, and produce realible estimates of confidence in our predictions.



Our research uses stochastic methods as the basis for advancing our understanding of hypersonic flows by developing stochastic modeling techniques applied to a broad range of hypersonic flow problems. Our research truly lives at the boundaries between applied mathematics and Aerospace engineering. We are particularly interested in three aspects of uncertainty modeling: understanding of complex models and their high-order interactions by functional decompositions and sensitivity analyse

**Stochastic modeling**

Hypersonic flow modeling and experiments are complex. Hypersonic flow models require of different very well-understood constitutive laws for the accurate simulation of both in-flight and on-ground conditions. Experimental
