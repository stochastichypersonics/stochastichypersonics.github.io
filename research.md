# Research

**Modeling uncertainty is one of the key challenges in hypersonics today**. Only a handful of all the produced research include uncertainty as a modeled component. New, surprising insights are being gained by trying to attain some objectivity in model calibration and validation tasks. As an interesting side note, the natural sciences (e.g. Physics, Astronomy, Astrophysics, Particle Physics, etc) have already understood this since quite some time. Actually, most of the recent notable discoveries in Science (e.g. gravitional waves, Higgs boson, etc) could only be confirmed to claim that "something new has been discovered" only by using rigorous uncertainty and Bayesian inference analyses to show the confidence in their results. It is very interesting to see that Nobel Prize-worthy research papers are like a masterclass in Bayesian inference techniques! However, us in Engineering disciplines have been left quite behind on this matter. Once our disciplines have reached a substantial level of complexity, ad-hoc techniques used to guide experiments and validate models are no longer reliable. This complexity pushes us to embrace more mathematically rigorous techniques that can unbiasedly look at our models, our experiments, and produce realible estimates of confidence in our predictions.

*Every time a scientific paper presents a bit of data, it's accompanied by an error bar – a quiet but insistent reminder that no knowledge is complete or perfect. It's a calibration of how much we trust what we think we know. If the error bars are small, the accuracy of our empirical knowledge is high; if the error bars are large, then so is the uncertainty in our knowledge* - Carl Sagan

*The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance; it is the illusion of knowledge.* - Stephen Hawking

Our research uses stochastic methods as the basis for advancing our understanding of hypersonic flows. We are interested in developing stochastic modeling techniques to be applied to a broad range of hypersonic flow problems such as gas-phase chemistry, gas-surface interactions, shock layer radiation, boundary layer transition, etc. Our research truly lives at the boundaries between applied mathematics and Aerospace engineering. We are particularly interested in three aspects of uncertainty modeling: 1) understanding of complex models and their high-order interactions by functional decompositions and sensitivity analyses; 2) using this information to design more informative experiments for model calibration and validation, leading to better utilization of experimental resources; 3) validation of physico-chemical and fluid dynamics models.

While models require of very different constitutive laws for the accurate simulation of both in-flight and on-ground conditions, experiments cannot measure explicitly all that would be desired for reliable validation. Complex modeling choices together with complex experimental set-ups render the use of off-the-shelves stochastic methods not adequate for hypersonic problems.

In the present study, we explore the possibility of exploiting different sources of experimental data for the purpose of statistically inferring both phenomenological and kinetic models for nitridation reaction efficiencies.

<!-- In this work, we answer the question: "can we learn anything from intrusive measurements in a plasma wind tunnel about gas-phase chemical reactions?" This question has long been dominated in the hypersonics community by almost exclusively looking at shock tube experiments, and the study of radiative signatures of selected excited species in the post-shock region created in such facilities. Forward rate of reactions can very effectively be obtained through the use of those data. Boundary layer modeling requires accurate modeling of backward (e.g. recombination) rates which are generally derived by assuming the principle of detailed balance to be true, possibly giving a biased view on recombination kinetics from shock tube data. In this work, we flip the switch and use experimental data sensitive to boundary layer quantities to obtain calibrated forward rates that, while still relying on the same principle of detailed balance, produce a consistent estimation of backward rates as they are now the drivers of the inference performed with this new set of experimental data. Apart from that, we are also able to prescribe interesting follow-up works that can help in obtaining a rigorous validation of gas-phase chemical models in hypersonic flows. -->

Direct measurements are significantly affected by uncertaintes that are not characterized, and indirect measurements have to consider a large number of unknowns to produce an estimation. The reliable characterization of free-stream conditions in on-ground facilities remains a challenge and represents one of the biggest roadblocks for validation tasks in hypersonic flows. In our group, we have started tackling this problem in plasma wind tunnels. The first effort was focused on building a low-dimensional stochastic framework. A later work included uncertainties stemming from chemical models, measured boundary conditions and surface response of intrusive probes when the free-stream is to be determined from indirect measurements.
