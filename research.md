# Research

**Modeling uncertainty is one of the key challenges in hypersonics today**. Only a handful of all the produced research include uncertainty as a modeled component. New, surprising insights are being gained by trying to attain some objectivity in model calibration and validation tasks. As an interesting side note, the natural sciences (e.g. Physics, Astronomy, Astrophysics, Particle Physics, etc) have already understood this since quite some time. Actually, most of the recent notable discoveries in Science (e.g. gravitional waves, Higgs boson, etc) could only be confirmed to claim that "something new has been discovered" only by using rigorous uncertainty and Bayesian inference analyses to show the confidence in their results. It is very interesting to see that Nobel Prize-worthy research papers are like a masterclass in Bayesian inference techniques! However, us in Engineering disciplines have been left quite behind on this matter. Once our disciplines have reached a substantial level of complexity, ad-hoc techniques used to guide experiments and validate models are no longer reliable. This complexity pushes us to embrace more mathematically rigorous techniques that can unbiasedly look at our models, our experiments, and produce realible estimates of confidence in our predictions.

*Every time a scientific paper presents a bit of data, it's accompanied by an error bar â€“ a quiet but insistent reminder that no knowledge is complete or perfect. It's a calibration of how much we trust what we think we know. If the error bars are small, the accuracy of our empirical knowledge is high; if the error bars are large, then so is the uncertainty in our knowledge* - Carl Sagan

*The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance; it is the illusion of knowledge.* - Stephen Hawking

Our research uses stochastic methods as the basis for advancing our understanding of hypersonic flows. We are interested in developing stochastic modeling techniques to be applied to a broad range of hypersonic flow problems such as gas-phase chemistry, gas-surface interactions, shock layer radiation, boundary layer transition, etc. Our research truly lives at the boundaries between applied mathematics and Aerospace engineering. We are particularly interested in three aspects of uncertainty modeling: 1) understanding of complex models and their high-order interactions by functional decompositions and sensitivity analyses; 2) using this information to design more informative experiments for model calibration and validation, leading to better utilization of experimental resources; 3) validation of physico-chemical and fluid dynamics models.

<!-- Hypersonic flow modeling and experiments are complex. While models require of very different constitutive laws for the accurate simulation of both in-flight and on-ground conditions, experiments cannot measure explicitly all that would be desired for reliable validation. Complex modeling choices together with complex experimental set-ups renders the use of off-the-shelves stochastic methods not adequate for hypersonic problems. Our group works on developing stochastic models tailored to hypersonics to produce reliable uncertainty estimations, model calibrations and validations.
